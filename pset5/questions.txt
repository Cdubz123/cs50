    save the return value outside of the function call.
4.  Main loads the dictionary into memory, as well as the text to check. Then 
    it reads the text one character at a time, It checks if the character is a 
    letter or a ' (if we're already inside of a word) and adds that letter to
    the word. If the word is longer than 45 character, we read the rest of the 
    word and move on. If the word has a digit in it, we also discard the word.
    Once we hit any other character, the word is complete, we add the null
    character at the end, increment our word count, check if the word is
    mispelled, and print it to the terminal if so.
5.  fscanf might try and write a word longer than our maximum length to our
    array.
