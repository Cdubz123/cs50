0.  How many colors does each format support?

GIF has a maximum of 256 colors.
BMP, JPEG, and PNG can be up to 24 bit (16.8million colors)

1.  Which of the formats supports animation?
GIF

2.  What is the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
Lossy makes inexact approximations about the data in the image to save on file 
size, but it can degrade the image. Lossless compression will allow you to 
perfectly reconstruct the original image, but can be much larger.

3.  Which of these formats is lossy compressed?
JPEG

4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file 
system?
The system modifies the filename's first character to signal it has been deleted
and the space can be recycled. Then it moves the file cluster to the hard
drive's "free cluster" area, but doesn't actually do anything with the cluster 
itself.

5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files
you delete cannot be recovered?
Use a tool to write zeros or a random sequance of values in every block of the
hard drive.
